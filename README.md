## 💡 Project Overview
This project was built as part of the **LearnJavaScript.online** curriculum. The goal was to build a functional dashboard that allows users to search for a specific GitHub username and retrieve:
* The user's profile information (Username, Repository name, and Repository description).
* A list of their latest repositories.

This project focuses heavily on **Asynchronous JavaScript** and handling API responses.

## ✨ Key Features
* **User Search:** Dynamic querying of the GitHub database.
* **API Integration:** Uses `fetch` and `async/await` to handle JSON data.
* **Error Handling:** gracefully manages cases where a user does not exist.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically generates HTML elements based on API results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: `Fetch API`, `Promises`, `Async/Await`, `DOM API`
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
